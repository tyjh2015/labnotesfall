LAB NOTES
(Marxists) superstructural problems:  
global imbalances
production of knowledge--
to visualize the material conditions of the pathway: from fingers to computer, to how it reaches the viewers, and how texts found their way to you, why you're reading something (over another.)

To think of a document as a vector.   it travels--through space, electrons; through time, etc.

Indeterminacy of a document---

e.g., editing a document, you may never know when it's finished.  from the writer's to the editors, years later. 

different vectors are ecosystems with different affordances
the way your email is stored--through gmail as vector--has some affordances, e.g. will back up your emails
amazon as vector for an ebook.  
your documents, however, may need to be backed up
encryption of vectors to protect your privacy

The origin point of all these vectors (email, calendar, documents etc--all which need to be backed up, encrypted, sent, etc--common problems)

a computer is a machine that can emulate any other machine  (CITE?)
this frees us from the confines of the physical universe

eben moglen--professor of law at Columbia
says we should own the hardware.   (even though we can't mine silicon)
we should plug our machines into servers available everywhere, and make our own servers

----
unify across vectors
in order to search across vectors, you could keep everything in a plain text file, rather than encrypted.   (non proprietary, long lasting)
plain text is the most under your control--accessible searchable, etc.   not really apolitical--associated with cyber punk movement
encryption is classified under military technology under the Espionage Act-- teaching people about encryption is criminal
plain text enables strong encryption-
if you want your work to reach places where there is censorship...



a tech choice that gives you the greatest amount of freedom, in effect.  


in microsoft word, we write and format at the same time--form is not separate from content.  if we want to make something italic, we highlight and press the button, and it becomes visible.  
the formatting must be embedded underneath the content/document.   that formatting layer is proprietary.  the thing that will re-create it is a printer (which flattens content) and MS Word itself.  a rendering engine that goes through your work.  

typesetting---strips the formatting and then puts their own and lay out the page
the smart thing would be to separate the form from the content.  

Docx
the x is for xml extensible markup language--you can mark up anything --identify features that are important (to you)

in html, it is semantic.  it does not transfer the formatting.  good for both small and big screen to transfer content. form and content separate. 
e.g. paragraph--it's a semantic structure so can look different --- indent or a space between? 

paragraph is a logical unit (a semantic element), while italics is not a logical unit
--

semantics, style and content

html doesn't do the following...
--human readable

--answer to aristotelian idea of separation of semantics, content and style
